Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data in the produced file Tidy_Data.txt
The txt file "Tidy_Data.txt" contains 180 rows and 68 columns.

The following steps as per the assignment were conducted as follows: 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of   each variable for each activity and each subject.

The steps are as follows: 

- In this project, the reshape2 package was used
- The data was downloaded from the provided link into the working directory and then unzipped
- An R script was written that will conducted the required steps
- Activity_Labels, Features, contains the loaded data from the downloaded files. 
- Required_Features.names contains the the extracted required data from the loaded data, i.e. the mean and the Std Dev. 
- X_Training and X_Testing contains the loaded combined datasets from the downloaded files
- Meged_Data containes the merged labeled data 
- 
Identifiers
Subject - The ID of the test subject
Activity - The type of activity 

The Subject included the following: 

WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
